Network Configuration Management with Ansible and Git

The example playbook consists of ASA, NXOS and IOS based devices. You can have login credentials encrypted using vault and have a group_vars file with connection information for each group. 

You can remove unwanted lines from the configuration file by using Ansible 'lineinfile' module.
